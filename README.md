# School District Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Prepare analysis of standardized test date to provide insight into performance trends and patterns within a school district. At the school and district level, the results will be used for discussions and strategic decisions. The analysis will further assist the school board and superintendant in making decisions regarding school budgets and priorities.

## School District Analysis requirements:
1. Snapshot of the school district's key metrics
2. Overview of the key metrics for each school
3. Top 5 Schools based on passing rate
4. Bottom 5 Schools based on passing rate
5. Average Math scores by student in each grade level by School
6. Average Reading scores by student in each grade level by School
7. School Performance based on Budget per student
8. School performance based on school size
9. School performance based on the type of school

Additionally, we are asked to prepare the same statistics above with marks for Grade 9 students at **Thomas High School** removed due to a problem with academic honesty. We will then run the analysis again and compare the results.

## Modified School District Analysis requirements:
1. Replace ninth grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School
2. Snapshot of the school district's key metrics
3. Overview of the key metrics for each school
4. Top 5 Schools based on passing rate
5. Bottom 5 Schools based on passing rate
6. Average Math scores by student in each grade level by School
7. Average Reading scores by student in each grade level by School
8. School Performance based on Budget per student
9. School performance based on school size
10. School performance based on the type of school
